# Hello

👋 I'm Marcus. 

I'm a computational biologist who works on genome sequencing projects. From individual
patients to large cohorts of tens of thousands.

I'm interested in large-scale genomics, cancer genomics, population genetics, and how 
to use large language models to study these genomes.

I work with a wide range of languages and technologies. I tend to write most of
my new programming projects in Python or Go, but have a large set of Java tools for bioinformatics 
workflow in [ngsutilsj](https://github.com/compgen-io/ngsutilsj) and 
[cgpipe](https://github.com/compgen-io/cgpipe). I also work on HPC clusters, 
so many of my tools are related to job orchestration.

Here is where I'll start documenting my work more publicly.
